## ðŸ§  Personalized Learning Path Agent

### ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements an intelligent agent that generates a **personalized 5-week learning path**, tailored to the user's goals, previous experience, and profile. It uses **LangChain 0.3+**, **LangGraph**, and **LLM models** to guide the construction of the plan through a conversational interface.

The agent starts with a short interaction to understand what the user wants to learn and their current experience level. Based on this:

* It classifies their educational or professional profile.
* It generates a structured week-by-week study plan.
* It adapts the content to the detected level.

This flow is designed to scale and includes LangGraph nodes that can be extended, modified, or connected to future APIs.

### ðŸ”„ Agent Flow (LangGraph)

```text
ask_user_input âž” classify_profile âž” generate_plan
```

1. `ask_user_input.py` asks the user:

   * What they want to learn (`goal`)
   * Their current experience (`experience`)

2. `classify_profile.py` processes this information and classifies the user as "Beginner", "Career Switcher", "Technical", etc.

3. `generate_plan.py` builds a week-by-week learning plan adapted to the user's profile and objectives.

### ðŸ“˜ Example Usage

```bash
python graph.py
```

Expected output:

```
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m your learning path assistant.

ðŸ§  What would you like to learn?
> I want to learn artificial intelligence for marketing

ðŸ“š What is your current experience level?
> Iâ€™m a marketing expert but Iâ€™ve never programmed

ðŸ”¹ Profile detected: Career Switcher

ðŸ“š Personalized learning plan:
Week 1: Introduction to AI
Week 2: Python basics
...
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Possible Future Extensions

* Export the plan to PDF or HTML
* Integration with real course APIs (Coursera, Udemy...)
* Learning style selector node (visual, hands-on, self-paced)
* Web interface using FastAPI or Gradio
* History of saved plans per user
